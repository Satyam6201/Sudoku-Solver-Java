# 🧩 Sudoku Solver & Puzzle Generator (Java Console App)

This is a fully functional **Sudoku game** written in Java. It includes a **random puzzle generator**, a **solver using backtracking**, **difficulty levels**, **smart hint system**, **lives system**, **move counter**, **timer**, and the ability to **save/load your progress** — all from the **command line interface**.

Built as a modular, object-oriented Java project, this console-based app showcases problem-solving, algorithmic logic, and clean code structure.
